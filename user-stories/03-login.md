# User Story: User Login

As a user...

I will be able to clearly understand that I need to type my email and my password into the provided forms.

The "Login" button should transition from its initial grey state to its full color when the username and password are both entered.

If the email and password do not match, the user should see an overlay that states "The Email and Password you Entered do not match"

Beneath the "Login" button, the I should see a text link to reset my password with a temporary password.
