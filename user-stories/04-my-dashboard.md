# User Story: Create New Repertoire

As a user...

I will see a text box where I can input my repertoire name.

I will see a horizontal line between the repertoire name box and the three inputs that follow it.

The three inputs I see will be...

1. Type (for v.2)
 * This drop-down menu will allow me to select between repertoire input types such as button, toggle, or slider
2. Label
 * Will allow me to input the label for the repertoire input that I will use during a session
3. Color
 * This drop down menu will allow me to select from a list of common colors to style the repertoire input

After these custom input selectors, I will see a button which will allow me to add options for an additional repertoire input
