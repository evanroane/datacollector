# User Story: User Account Registration

As a user...

In order register successfully, I should be able to clearly read and understand all the information the site requires from me.

I should know if I skipped a required field with a visual que such as a red form text box border.

I will know if the form is not ready when the "Register Account" button is greyed out.

I will be provided with example occupations and I will understand that this field is optional.

I will be informed that my email address will be my login username.

I will know that I have filled out all required fields when the "Register Account" button is its full default color.
